# Wasmi Benchmarking Suite

This includes execution and compilation benchmarks for the Wasmi interpreter and other Wasm runtimes.

## Runtimes

The following Wasm runtimes and configurations are included.

| Runtime | ID | Configurations | Note |
|:-------:|:---------------|:-----|:---|
| [Wasmi v0.31] | `wasmi-v0.31` | | The old version of the Wasmi Wasm interpreter. |
| [Wasmi v0.32] | `wasmi-v0.32` | `eager`, `eager.unchecked`, `lazy`, `lazy.unchecked`, `lazy-translation` | New Wasmi Wasm interpreter version with major updates. |
| [Tinywasm] | `tinywasm` | | Very tiny zero-dependencies Wasm interpreter. |
| [Wasm3] | `wasm3` | `eager`, `lazy` | A very fast well-established Wasm interpreter. |
| [Wasmtime] | `wasmtime` | `cranelift`, `winch` | Well established Wasm JIT runtime with cutting edge Wasm features. Winch only works on `x86` platforms. |
| [Wasmer] | `wasmer` | `cranelift`, `singlepass` | Universal Wasm JIT runtime with many bindings to other language ecosystems. |
| [Stitch] | `stitch` | | New experimental and very fast zero-dependencies Wasm interpreter. |

Ideally we had more Wasm runtimes, e.g. [WAMR], [Toywasm] and [Wain] but those had no proper Rust bindings or sufficiently flexible APIs respectively.

### Configuration Explanation

- `eager`: All function bodies are compiled and validated immediately.
- `eager.unchecked`: Function bodies are compiled eagerly but Wasm validation is skipped.
- `lazy`: Function bodies are only compiled and validated upon first use.
- `lazy.unchecked`: Function bodies are only compiled upon first use and Wasm validation is skipped.
- `lazy-translation`: Function bodies are lazily compiled but eagerly validated.
- `cranelift`: The runtime uses the Cranelift code generator.
- `wasmtime.winch`: Wasmtime's JIT optimized for fast start-up times.
- `wasmer.singlepass`: Wasmer's JIT optimized for fast start-up times.

**Note:** by default runtimes compile and validate function bodies eagerly.

## Usage

Run all benchmarks via:

```
cargo bench
```

**Note:** compilation might take some minutes since we are compiling a lot of Wasm runtimes with very high optimization settings.

Filter benchmarks via

- `compile`: for compilation benchmarks.
- `execute`: for execution benchmarks.
- The runtime `ID`, e.g. `wasmi-v0.31` or `wasm3`.
- The runtime configuration on top of the runtime `ID`, e.g. `wasmi-v0.32.lazy`.
- Single test names, e.g. `counter` (execute) or `ffmpeg` (compile)

Examples

Run all runtimes on the `counter` execution benchmark test case:

```
cargo bench execute/counter
```

Run all Wasm3 test cases with its eager compilation configuration:

```
cargo bench wasm3.eager
```

## Test Cases

The Wasmi benchmarking test suite provides the following test cases:

| Mode | Test Case | Notes |
|:----:|:---------:|:------|
| | | |
| `execute` | | |
| | `counter` | Simple loop that counts a single local up to some number. |
| | `fib.recursive` | Recursive fibonacci calculation. Call-intense workload. |
| | `fib.iterative` | Iterative fibonacci calculation. Compute intense workload. |
| | `fib.tailrec` | Tail-call based fibonacci calculation. |
| | `primes` | Calculates all primes until some number. Uses linear memory for storing known primes. |
| | `matmul` | Naive matrix multiplication implementation. Makes heavy use of linear memory and floats. |
| | `argon2` | Password hashing library. Compute- and memory intense workload. |
| | `bulk-ops` | Show cases the Wasm [`bulk-memory-operations`] proposal. |
| | | |
| `compile` | | |
| | `bz2` | Medium-sized compression library with huge function bodies. (WASI required) |
| | `pulldown-cmark` | Medium-sized markdown renderer. (WASI required) |
| | `spidermonkey` | The firefox Javascript execution engine. (large, WASI required) |
| | `ffmpeg` | Huge multimedia library. (WASI required) |
| | `coremark` | CoreMark benchmarking compilation. (kinda small, no WASI) |
| | `argon2` | Password hashing library. (small, no WASI) |
| | `erc20` | ink! based ERC-20 implementation. (tiny, no WASI) |

## Coremark

This benchmark suite also contains a Coremark test which can be run via

```
cargo run --profile bench
```

This will run Coremark using all available Wasm VMs and print their 
Coremark scores to the console. Higher scores are better.

## Plotting

In order to run the benchmarks and simultaneously plot diagrams of their results use the following command:

```
cargo criterion --bench criterion --message-format=json | cargo run --bin plot
```

This generates plots in the `target/wasmi-benchmarks` folder for all the benchmark groups.
In order to use this you may need to install `cargo-criterion` via `cargo install cargo-criterion`.

In case you want to collect data first and plot later you can also instead store
the benchmark results into a file and use the file to plot the data later:

```
cargo criterion --bench criterion --message-format=json > results.json
cat results.json | cargo run --bin plot
```
